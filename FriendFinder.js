The Friend Finder app will ask 10 questions. Each answer will be on a scale of 1 to 5 based on how much the user answers the questions.

Determine the user's most compatible friends.
Each user's answers will display as numbers 1-5.
Then it'll compare the difference between current user's scores against those from other users.
The closest match will be the user with the least amount of difference.

Once its found the current user's most compatible friend, a window will display the result with a photo and name of the closest match.
